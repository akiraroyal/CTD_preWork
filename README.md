My project for Code the Dream

I used TheDogAPI

#How to run the app
1. Download or clone the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  

#How it Works
Click on the Show Breeds button and a list of 5 dog breeds with their names and temperaments will show  
Click on the Show Images and random dog images will pop up
